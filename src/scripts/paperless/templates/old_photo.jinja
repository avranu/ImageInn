	"title": "Outdoor Patient Gathering at HRSH, 1950s",
	"description": "The image depicts a gathering of patients and staff outdoors in a sprawling courtyard at the Hudson River Psychiatric Center. The scene features a lush, well-maintained lawn dotted with rows of wooden benches, and a series of tall oak trees providing partial shade. A man wearing a dark suit stands behind a simple wooden podium, addressing the assembled audience. Many attendees are dressed in uniform-like garments or simple, lightweight clothing appropriate for a warm day. In the distance, a large, multi-story institutional brick building displays tall windows with arched frames, indicative of mid-19th-century construction. Several balconies overlook the courtyard, and a few onlookers can be seen peering down at the gathering.\n\nNear the podium, an American flag is prominently displayed alongside a small bouquet of flowers. Some children, likely visitors or relatives of the staff, play quietly near the trees, occasionally glancing at the speaker. The ambiance is formal yet communal, suggesting a celebratory or commemorative event. The overall color palette is moderately faded, with pastel hues dominating the clothing and greenery that looks somewhat washed out — characteristic of color photographs from the mid-20th century. A handwritten sign in the background reads 'Annual Staff & Patient Wellness Ceremony — 1952.' Patients and staff seem engaged, some taking notes, while a nurse dressed in a crisp white uniform circulates among them, offering refreshments.\n\nAdditional Notes: At the lower right corner of the photograph, a date has been stamped: 'Oct 5, 1952.' The expression on many attendees' faces seems optimistic, and the presence of small children alongside staff indicates a relatively inclusive environment. A second banner, partially obscured by a tree branch, references a hospital anniversary celebration. Keywords: grass, leaves, ceremony, spring, summer, patriotic, speech, pastoral grounds, institutional life, wellness event, public address, historical architecture.",
